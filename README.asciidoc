== Building the Docs

You will need the latest version of
http://maven.apache.org/download.html[Maven 3] to build the
documentation.

Simply type:

----
mvn clean install
----

After the build you should find a PDFs in
+target/docbkx/pdf/+ and a web versions in
+target/docbkx/webhelp/+.

The web version contains a copy of the PDF, so you need only deploy
this version.
